                    <p>Time duration depends on following factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Location</li>
                        <li>Color of hair on white spot</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Your wellness journey can take anywhere between 3-12 months. We know this is a long time frame but this is the bitter truth and anyone telling you different on the internet does not have your best interest in mind.</p>

                <>
                    <p>A lot of people only want to know a fixed cost amount however, cost depends on the following factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Location - only face involved, or face +body involved, or face+body+palms/soles involved</li>
                        <li>Size - smaller patches can be relatively less costly compared to larger patches</li>

            answer: (
                <>
                    <p>Allopathy relies on suppression to avoid spreading. According to Allopath, this condition is incurable. Homeopathy science mentions that disease will increase first and then decrease. According to Ayurveda literature, this disease is difficult to treat.</p>
                    <p>We believe that this condition is a manageable disorder. Using a combination approach we believe in controlling the disease from spreading and re-pigmenting old white spots. Re-pigmentation and stability should happen at the same time for best results.</p>

                <>
                    <p>NO, we do not suggest strict diet restrictions. It is a common misconception that diet plays a very important role in your treatment but there is no scientific evidence on this even now. We know that many ayurveda doctors recommend strict diet restrictions but we believe role of diet is only 5%. Results on this page are proof of this theory.</p>

                    <p>This happens when you were on allopath before. If you suddenly stopped your allopath therapy 2 or 3 months before coming to us, the disease tends to flare up which was suppressed by previous your doctor.</p>
                    <p>This is why we recommend a combination approach to avoid this scenario.</p>
